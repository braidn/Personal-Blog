If you happened to stumble across Cloudbacon this morning, you have witnessed 
a slight change to the sidebar. Before, it simply read "CB" (CloudBacon for 
the peeps who had yet to figure it out) and a relatively cruddy icon for the RSS 
feed. Now, you are greeted with three separate icons. One, a cloud, Two, a piece of 
8-bit bacon, and lastly, a punch out of the weird RSS thing.

There are a couple of reasons for this change:

1. I was kinda bored, ok? It happens.
2. There is a high likelyhood that people can't read:

    * [Here](http://www.life360.com/blog/rich-americans-cant-read-peoples-emotions/)
    * [And Here](http://thestir.cafemom.com/food_party/129526/white_coke_cans_pulled_because)
3. Really these are just a few, it's ridiculous actually.

If you can't read, THUMBS UP, you know where you are, yet you might not be able 
to do too much else from here...including reading this. Anyway, if you absolutely 
dislike the whole [iconographic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconography) thing, 
feel free to send me some FUD at braden[at]buyurifemme{dot}com.

In finishing this up, there are a lot of articles built into my backlog, so they 
might be on their way out but, really no one knows. At most, don't hold your breath.
